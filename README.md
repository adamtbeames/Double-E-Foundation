## Hi there!

<p>This is a starter theme for WordPress based on Foundation 6 which started as a fork of <a href="https://github.com/olefredrik">Ole Fredrik Lie's FoundationPress</a>.</p>

<p>I started with version 2.2.0 of the awesome FoundationPress starter theme (a Foundation 6 version), and customised it to my usual needs and workflow (rearranged stuff, removed stuff I didn't need, added some nifty functions, etc). I generally do not sync with FoundationPress anymore as this project has taken on a life of its own for me.</p>

## Foundation version?

<p>Zurb Foundation 6.1.1.</p>

## License

<p>General Public License (GPL) v2</a>.</p>

## Examples of work

<p>My first adventure in forking FoundationPress was short-lived, because that was built with Foundation 5 and Foundation 6 came out soon after. It was easier to fork the updated FoundationPress than to update that fork, which was called WP-Foundation-Starterkit. Sites I built using that were:</p>
